1. Introduction
Electroencephalography (EEG) is a critical technique in neuroscience that records the electrical activity of the brain. As EEG-based research continues to grow across multiple domains, managing large volumes of structured data has become increasingly important. This project addresses this need by providing a comprehensive system for organizing EEG research data, enabling efficient querying, ensuring scalability, and supporting integration with analytical tools and machine learning models.
1.1 Project Background
EEG data analysis presents unique challenges due to its high dimensionality, temporal nature, and sensitivity to noise. Modern research requires not only the storage of raw signal data but also comprehensive metadata about subjects, researchers, experimental conditions, and analytical results. This project creates an infrastructure that supports the entire EEG research workflow, from data acquisition to advanced analysis.
